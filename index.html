    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    </p>
        
    <p> Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        Though as for that the passing there<br>
        Had worn them really about the same,
    </p>   
        
    <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
       In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
       Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
       Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
       I doubted if I should ever come back.
    </p>
